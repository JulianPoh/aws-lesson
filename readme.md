AWS Primer 
======

We will try our hand at deploying to AWS. More specifically create a RDS (Relational Database Service) and an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance. 

You will use the RDS service to create a DB instance. A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the cloud, it can contain multiple user-created databases, and you can access it by using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone database instance.

EC2 allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. It encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired, e.g NodeJS express app. 

Prerequisites
------

* Register for free-tier AWS account.
* Download and install either Postico or pgAdmin.
* WSL or a terminal program if you are running windows.

We will set-up an AWS RDS instance first.

RDS:
------
1. Go to the AWS Management console. Under AWS services, select ``RDS (Relational Database Service)``

2. Create database.

For the purpose of this app we will create a postgreSQL database.
Select Dev/Test for the free tier usage.

Configs :
```
Instance class - 
Specifies the computational power, memory & storages allocated to the instance.

Multi AZ deployment - Creates replicas in a different Availability Zone (AZ) to provide data redundancy,
eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups.

Storage type - 
General purpose SSD
	VS
Provisioned IOPS, suitable for I/O-intensive database workloads. 
Provides flexibility to provision I/O ranging from 1,000 - 30,000 IOPS 
IOPS = (InputOutput PerSecond).

DB instance id - Used to identify your instances, NOT your DB name!
Master username & password - Master creditentials, don't forget this.

```
##### Attention!
In non-production enviroments, Just select `Only enable options eligible for free-tier`. You don't want to get a bill shock, because you do need to key in your credit card info to get started.

##### Advance settings :
Use defaults

You will not be able to select the afforability zones in the free tier,
But naturally in production enviroments, if you're in SG you'll want to have your instance deployed in SG

DB name = Project4

Create instance and wait.

Check Instance- status

Mac Users - Postico
pgAdmin

For the purpose of testing and development, we would need to edit the security group settings.
notice the name lanuch wizard. let the inbound and outbound to be anywhere.
